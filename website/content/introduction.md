OpenType features allow fonts to behave smartly. This behavior can do simple things (e.g. change letters to small caps) or they can do complex things (e.g. insert swashes, alternates, and ligatures to make text set in a script font feel handmade). This document aims to be a designer friendly introduction to understanding and developing these features. The goal is not to teach you how to write a small caps feature or a complex script feature. Rather, the goal is to teach you the logic and techniques for developing features. Once you understand those, you'll be able to create OpenType features that fit your design as perfectly as possible.

This document is written with the assumption that you have a basic working knowledge of the structure of a font. You need to know the differences between characters and glyphs, understand the coordinate system in glyphs and so on.

OpenType is writing direction agnostic, but the examples in this document are for left to right writing systems. Refer to the official OpenType specifications for further information on this matter.
